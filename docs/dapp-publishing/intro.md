# Welcome, Publishers!

We're excited to guide you through the process of publishing your Web3 apps on the Solana dApp Store, the fee-free app store designed specifically for the [Saga](https://solanamobile.com/saga) device.

## Why Publish on the Solana dApp Store?

The Solana dApp Store is an exclusive platform for the Saga, Solana Mobile’s flagship Android phone built for Web3. By publishing on the dApp Store, you'll reach an audience of highly engaged, Web3-savvy users, and benefit from publisher policies that are fully compatible with crypto use cases like NFTs, DeFi, payments, blockchain gaming, and more.

### A Friendly Home for Web3 Content

The Solana dApp Store is built to support a wide range of Web3 activities. dApps can freely enable users to buy, sell, and trade digital goods, engage in DeFi, offer token-gated experiences, facilitate microtransactions, and use any payment system they choose, without restrictive policies getting in the way.

### Truly Fee-Free

When we say fee-free, we mean it. Solana Mobile Inc. does not collect any fees from users of the dApp Store. While there may be network transaction fees or app-specific fees associated with using the store or the apps it offers, none of these fees go to Solana Mobile Inc.

### Publishing vs. Curation

On the Solana dApp Store, apps are published on-chain and represented as NFTs. These NFTs represent you as the publisher, your app, and each of its releases. Ownership of the private key for the minting account gives you the authority to publish new versions of your app. Each NFT contains the details necessary to display your app’s information to users.

After minting, you submit your app NFT details to the Solana dApp publisher portal for inclusion in the store’s catalog. This catalog is curated by Solana Mobile Inc. according to our publisher policies.
