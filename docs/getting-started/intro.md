The **Solana Mobile Stack (SMS)** is an open source collection of libraries that provides key technologies for building Mobile dApps that can interact with the Solana network. This documentation site provides guides, tutorials, and references to help developers get started building on Solana Mobile.

The SDK is primarily developed and maintained by the [Solana Mobile](https://github.com/solana-mobile) team, but welcomes contributions from the community!

:::note
You don't need a Saga device or physical device to build on Solana Mobile. See [**prerequisite setup**](quickstart#prerequisite-setup) to set up your development environment and start building!
